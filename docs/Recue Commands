SCOS Operational Runbook

Purpose

Quick recovery and verification checklist for live Screeps operations.

Room Constants

- HOME: `E58S56`
- TARGET: `E57S56`
- EXPANSION: `E57S55`

Expected Mission Quotas

- `builder@E57S56`: 2
- `upgrader@E57S56`: 1
- `claimer@E57S55` (reserve): 1
- `remoteMiner@E57S55`: 4

Heartbeat Interpretation

- `ASSIGN B@T:x/2 U@T:y/1 C@E:z/1 RM@E:n/4`
- `Spawn:BUSY <name> (<ticks>)` means queue is progressing.
- `Spawn:IDLE | QUEUE clear` means quotas are satisfied.
- `Spawn blocked: role=<role> code=<err>` means spawn attempt failed.

Console Checks

- Role totals:
- `_.countBy(Game.creeps, c => c.memory.role)`

- Target-room builders:
- `_.filter(Game.creeps, c => c.memory.role === 'builder' && c.memory.workRoom === 'E57S56').length`

- Target-room upgraders:
- `_.filter(Game.creeps, c => c.memory.role === 'upgrader' && c.memory.targetRoom === 'E57S56').length`

- Expansion claimers:
- `_.filter(Game.creeps, c => c.memory.role === 'claimer' && c.memory.targetRoom === 'E57S55').length`

- Expansion remote miners:
- `_.filter(Game.creeps, c => c.memory.role === 'remoteMiner' && c.memory.targetRoom === 'E57S55').length`

Common Recovery Actions

- Claimer stuck in wrong room:
- remove or overwrite `creep.memory.targetRoom` to `E57S55`.

- Remote miner not expansion-assigned:
- set `creep.memory.targetRoom = 'E57S55'` and `creep.memory.homeRoom = 'E58S56'`.

- Upgrader working wrong room:
- set `creep.memory.targetRoom = 'E57S56'`.

- If assignments are heavily stale:
- recycle/retire misassigned creeps and let spawn policy repopulate.
