🗺️ Engineering Roadmap

✅ Phase 1: Bootstrapping (Completed)

[x] Establish basic game loop and GitHub repo.

[x] Implement "Emergency Recovery" mechanism.

[x] Milestone: System demonstrated resilience by autonomously surviving to RCL 4.

🔄 Phase 2: Stability & Infrastructure (Current)

Status: RCL 5 achieved. Codebase is stabilizing.
Objective: Resolve discrepancy between Controller Level (5) and Logic Level (2).

[x] Load Balancing: Implemented distributed source assignment.

[x] Observability: Implemented Census logging in Console.

[x] Diplomacy: Diplomat logic implemented and deployed.

[ ] Infrastructure Catch-up:

[x] Build Extensions to reach 700 Energy Cap.

[ ] Deploy Diplomat to reserve neighbor (In Progress).

🚧 Phase 3: Static Mining (The "RCL 5" Shift)

Goal: Switch from "Shuttles" to "Static Mining" using RCL 5 tech (Containers/Links).

[ ] Infrastructure: Build Roads to reduce movement fatigue (50% efficiency gain).

[ ] Containers: Place containers at Sources.

[ ] Role Split:

Miner: Stationary creep (5x WORK) that drop-mines into container.

Hauler: Fast creep (CARRY/MOVE) that only moves energy to Storage.

[ ] Tower Logic: Advanced defense and automated road repair.

🔮 Phase 4: Expansion & Market

[ ] Remote Mining: Harvest energy from neighboring rooms.

[ ] Automated Construction: Code that automatically places construction sites.

[ ] Market: Auto-sell excess resources.
